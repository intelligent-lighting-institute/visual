Visual Library for Processing

With this library you can make simple visual objects in Processing.
Each Visual object can be assigned a position and can be assigned simple hit-test mechanisms.
Furthermore the pre(), draw() and post() functions of Processing are automatically called when you initialize the object.

I'm currently working on a displaylist which allows you to determine the order in which visual objects are drawn.
